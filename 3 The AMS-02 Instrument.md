3. The AMS-02 Instrument

[mounted on the Internation Space Station (ISS)]
[launched on the 16th of May, 2011, aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour]

The three primary scientific objectives of the AMS-02 are:
- Measuring the flux and composition fo cosmic rays with great precision.
- Assisting in the search for antimatter and dark matter.
- Investigating the origin of cosmic rays and their propagation within our galaxy.

Key components:
- Magnetic spectrometer: a permanent magnet used to bend the trajectory of entering charged particles which allows determination of their charge and momentum.
- Time-of-Flight (TOF) system: times the particles travelling between detector end-points, helping to identify particle types.
- Transition radiation detector: ?
- Ring imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH): measures the velocity of entering charged particles with high precision by measuring the radiation emitted by the Cherenkov effect.
- Electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL): measures the energy of particles.
