## Composition

Cosmic rays are highly energetic particles originating from outer space travelling at near the speed of light. Due to their high energy, any electrons are stripped away leaving a positively charged nucleus. During high-altitude balloon experiments, they were first measured by Victor Hess in 1912 as ionising radiation. As the strength of this radiation increased with altitude, it was deduced it was of extraterrestial origin. Since then a lot of research has been done to cosmic rays. ... Cosmic rays help us to understand high-energy processes within our universe, characteristics of the intersteller medium, fundamental properties of particles, and the Sun's as well as Earth's electromagnetic fields.

Cosmic rays are mostly composed of protons, about 90%, helium nuclei, about 9%, and a remaining fraction of heavier nuclei and electrons.

## Energy spectrum

Depending on their origin, we distinguish three types of cosmic rays:
- Solar cosmic rays: protons and some heavier ions ejected and accelerated by solar flares and coronal mass ejections from the Sun.
- Galactic cosmic rays: thought to mostly originate from stellar remnants accelerated by supernovae within our own galaxy, the Milky Way.
- Extragalactic cosmic rays: the most energetic particles originating from more extreme sources outside our galaxy such as active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, and quasars.

The energy spectrum of cosmic rays follows a power-law distribution, modulated by the interstellar medium and solar activity. Accurate measurements of this spectrum can help us test theoretical models for cosmic ray acceleration and propagation.

## Propagation

Because cosmic rays carry an electric charge they are affected by magnetic fields they travel through. These fields will curve the trajectory of cosmic rays and slowly sap them of energy through processes such as XXX. This can lead to the 'entrapment' of cosmic rays within a magnetic field.

## What we can learn

Since protons are the most abundant component of comsmic rays, research into their flux can help us with additional knowledge on space weather, important for satellite operations and astronauts, and particle physics, allowing insight into proton processes of higher energy than attainable in accelators.
